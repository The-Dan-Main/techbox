        <h2>We rely on MACH</h2>
        <p>For your digital transformation, we rely on MACH technologies. MACH stands for Microservices, API-first,
            Cloud Native and Headless. Microservices are individual applications that perform a specific task in the
            system (for example, your company). These many microservices communicate with each other via interfaces
            called APIs, but function independently. So if a microservice fails, the entire system is not directly
            affected. Software can be conveniently accessed via cloud-native solutions, regardless of location. Last but
            not least, headless technology ensures maximum flexibility, as the content of your software is not dependent
            on the usual factors such as backend or programming language. This means your digitized workflow can be
            easily implemented across platforms. Our experts will be happy to help you exploit the full potential of
            these future-oriented technologies. </p>

        <h2>The digital enterprise</h2>
        <p>Digital technologies affect every company and their value chain. So the question is not whether digital
            transformation is relevant to a business model, but only to what extent. The profound, global digital
            transformation has made markets more fast-moving and diverse than ever before. Customers always want new,
            individual products that are safe and of high quality. In addition, they should still be affordable. A
            digital business model that achieves a fast time-to-market for new services or products has a significant
            advantage here. To achieve this speed, the digital enterprise is needed. Here, product development, process
            automation and digitization must go hand in hand. In development, for example, new ideas can be implemented
            and tested directly digitally. Cumbersome, cost-intensive product tests thus become necessary at the
            earliest when the idea is fully developed. The automation of your existing processes - for example, from the
            creation of an idea to its completion, or your ordering processes - ensures more free employees who can
            devote themselves to more complex topics. And, incidentally, the error and failure rate is reduced because
            the individual steps are carried out in a standardized manner. Digital business processes also simplify
            collaboration and coordination with third-party providers. For example, deliveries can be coordinated in a
            straightforward manner on specially developed digital platforms to ensure smooth production processes. The
            basis for all this is, of course, that important documents and data are digitized and made available to all
            relevant systems. However, you do not have to or can not digitize all steps in your value chain. At some
            points, it is advisable to build on the tried and tested, for example to strengthen customer loyalty, or
            because digitization is simply not possible. We will be happy to advise you on the best approach for the
            first or last steps of your transformation. We start with a basic, non-binding consultation regarding
            existing potential. As soon as we have jointly developed the action point with the greatest impact, we begin
            with agile development. To optimize your business, we build on state-of-the-art digital technologies from
            the MACH architecture. These offer you stability, speed and flexibility.</p>

        <h2>Techbox is more than happy to take on your digital challenges</h2>
        <p> Analog ways of working and processes are often slow and cost companies a lot of time and resources that
            could be put to better use. Digital transformation aims to holistically digitize, automate and, where
            possible, eliminate precisely these ways of working and processes. Based on the latest technologies, we
            create an infrastructure that meshes smoothly and efficiently covers both your employee and customer needs.
